WebLLM Chat is a pioneering initiative that combines the robust backend capabilities of WebLLM with the user-friendly interface of NextChat. As a part of the broader MLC.ai family, this project contributes to our mission of democratizing AI technology by making powerful tools accessible directly to end-users. By integrating with NextChat, WebLLM Chat not only enhances the chatting experience but also broadens the scope for deployment of self-hosted and customizable language models.

## Community and Contributions

WebLLM Chat thrives on community involvement. We are committed to fostering an inclusive and innovative community where developers and AI enthusiasts can collaborate, contribute, and push the boundaries of what's possible in AI technology.

## Acknowledgements

WebLLM Chat is built upon the remarkable work of the [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/) and [NextChat](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web) projects. We extend our sincere gratitude to the developers and contributors of these projects for their invaluable efforts in advancing the field of browser-based AI and creating user-friendly chat interfaces.

Further more, this project is only possible thanks to the shoulders of open-source ecosystems that we stand on. We want to thank the Apache TVM community and developers of the TVM Unity effort. The open-source ML community members made these models publicly available. PyTorch and Hugging Face communities make these models accessible. We would like to thank the teams behind Vicuna, SentencePiece, LLaMA, Alpaca. We also would like to thank the WebAssembly, Emscripten, and WebGPU communities. Finally, thanks to Dawn and WebGPU developers.
